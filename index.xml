      <description>Welcome to the first post in the Programming Puzzle of the Day (aka PPotD) series!
I came across this challenge on HackerRank, as part of a developer candidate test from a company that shall remain nameless ;)
My submission passed all of the automated test cases, but I remember it as being so sloppily written that I thought I&#39;d rewrite it just for the hell of it. Later on, I rewrote the whole thing in Golang, also just for the hell of it &amp;ndash; because why not?</description>

      <description>Every now and then, we&#39;d face situations where we&#39;re being asked to replace, keep or examine two different files &amp;ndash; such as when a new Ubuntu package comes with a new config file.
It&#39;s easy when we know whether to keep the old one or replace it altogether with the newer version, but what do we do when we&#39;re unsure and/or need to reconcile the difference between them? diff and patch comes to mind.</description>
